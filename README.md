This project my team and I were talking about data about video games made in 2004-2008 and made a presentation about it, we made graphs in tableau, and excel to demonstrate our questions we made. There was lots of data in this dataset so the questions we made were more for answering questions we had like what game had the most sales, what console produced the most games, questions like that. This project was a great start for me in my journey of collaboration with a group of people.
